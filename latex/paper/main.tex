Agricultural pest management is crucial for maintaining crop yields and ensuring food security. Traditional pest identification methods are time-consuming and require expert knowledge, limiting their scalability in modern agriculture. This paper presents a real-time, web-based pest detection system utilizing YOLOv11 (You Only Look Once version 11) for automated identification of agricultural pests. The system employs a custom-trained deep learning model capable of processing live webcam feeds, uploaded images, and video files. Our approach achieved significant performance improvements in pest detection accuracy while maintaining real-time processing capabilities. The model was trained on the "Insect Pest Detection in Agriculture using YOLO" dataset and optimized for web deployment using ONNX Runtime Web. The resulting system provides an accessible tool for farmers and agriculturists, enabling rapid pest identification without requiring specialized expertise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with competitive accuracy metrics and real-time inference capabilities suitable for field deployment.

\section{Introduction}

Agricultural pest management represents one of the most critical challenges in modern farming, directly impacting crop yields, food security, and economic sustainability \cite{ref1}. Traditional pest identification methods rely heavily on manual inspection by trained agriculturists, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to human error. The increasing global population and the corresponding demand for food production necessitate more efficient and scalable approaches to pest management \cite{ref2}.

Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have opened new avenues for automated pest detection and classification. Object detection algorithms, particularly the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in real-time object detection tasks \cite{ref3}. The latest iteration, YOLOv11, offers improved accuracy and efficiency, making it particularly suitable for agricultural applications where real-time processing is essential.

This paper presents a comprehensive web-based system for real-time agricultural pest detection using YOLOv11. Our contributions include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Development of a custom-trained YOLOv11 model specifically optimized for agricultural pest detection
\item Implementation of a web-based interface supporting multiple input modalities (webcam, image upload, video processing)
\item Optimization of the model for web deployment using ONNX Runtime Web technology
\item Comprehensive evaluation demonstrating real-time performance suitable for field deployment
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews related work in agricultural pest detection, Section III describes our methodology and system architecture, Section IV presents experimental results and performance analysis, Section V discusses the implications and limitations of our approach, and Section VI concludes with future research directions.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Traditional Pest Detection Methods}

Traditional agricultural pest detection relies primarily on visual inspection by trained experts who manually survey crops to identify pest infestations \cite{ref4}. While effective, this approach suffers from several limitations including scalability issues, subjectivity in identification, and the requirement for specialized knowledge. Additionally, the time-intensive nature of manual inspection often results in delayed detection, allowing pest populations to establish and cause significant crop damage.

\subsection{Computer Vision in Agriculture}

The application of computer vision techniques in agriculture has gained significant momentum in recent years. Early approaches utilized traditional image processing techniques combined with machine learning classifiers for pest and disease detection \cite{ref5}. However, these methods often required extensive feature engineering and performed poorly under varying environmental conditions.

\subsection{Deep Learning for Pest Detection}

The emergence of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has revolutionized agricultural pest detection. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for pest classification and detection \cite{ref6}. However, many of these approaches focused on classification rather than localization, limiting their practical applicability in field conditions.

\subsection{YOLO-based Object Detection}

The YOLO architecture has emerged as a leading approach for real-time object detection across various domains \cite{ref7}. Recent studies have applied YOLO variants to agricultural applications, demonstrating promising results for crop monitoring, disease detection, and pest identification \cite{ref8}. The evolution from YOLOv1 to YOLOv11 has consistently improved detection accuracy while maintaining real-time processing capabilities.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Dataset and Preprocessing}

We utilized the "Insect Pest Detection in Agriculture using YOLO" dataset from Kaggle \cite{dataset}, which contains annotated images of various agricultural pests. The dataset includes multiple pest species commonly found in agricultural settings, with bounding box annotations suitable for object detection tasks.

Data preprocessing steps included:
\begin{itemize}
\item Image resizing to 640×640 pixels

\item Data augmentation techniques including rotation, scaling, and color jittering
\item Train-validation-test split (70\%-20\%-10\%)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Training}

We employed transfer learning using a pre-trained YOLOv11 nano model (yolo11n.pt) as the starting point. The training process utilized the Ultralytics framework with the following configuration:

\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

The training process incorporated several optimization techniques:
\begin{itemize}
\item Learning rate scheduling with cosine annealing
\item Early stopping based on validation loss
\item Model checkpointing to preserve best-performing weights
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Optimization for Web Deployment}

To enable efficient web-based inference, we converted the trained PyTorch model to ONNX format and subsequently optimized it for ONNX Runtime Web. This process involved:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Export to ONNX format with dynamic input shapes
\item Optimization using ONNX Runtime tools
\item Conversion to .ort format for web assembly compatibility
\end{enumerate}

The optimization process significantly reduced model size while maintaining inference accuracy, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained web environments.

\end{figure}

The pest detection interface demonstrates the system's capability to accurately identify and localize agricultural pests within uploaded images. In the example shown, the system successfully detected a Cabbage Looper with precise bounding box coordinates and confidence metrics. The interface provides immediate visual feedback through bounding box overlays and detailed JSON response data for integration with other agricultural management systems.
